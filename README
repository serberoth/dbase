DBase
Written By: Serberoth
------------------------------------------------------------
DBase is a toy RESTful service database/table like web based
application.  The application handles the following routes:

/tables		-- Display all available tables
/tables/:table	-- Display the data for :table
/tables/:table/:key -- Display the data for the entry :key in table :table
/search?q=<regex> -- Search all tables for matching keys

The application handles HTTP GET for the above routes as well
as POST for the search route.

In addition to the above the application also handles POST
for /tables/:table where the expected post body content is
a JSON object. This will created or overwrite the specified
table with the provided content.
The /tables/:table/:key route handles PUT, again expecting
JSON body content.  This will create or update the :key in
the specified :table.
All of the /tables routes handle the DELETE method deleting
their respective content.

Running the application:

go run *.go

Miscellaneous Notes:

The tables are implemented using the Go out of the box
map which should be replaced by a keyed b-tree for more
efficient handling of larger data sets.  Additionally
the application is non-transactional, changes to the
data are made on a first-come first-served basis and
race conditions may exist.
